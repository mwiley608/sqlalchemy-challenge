Bootcamp SQL Alchemy Challenge
The files contained in the SurfsUp folder were created as a homework assignment to analyze climate data in Honolulu, Hawaii prior to a holiday vacation. The dataset includes the precipitation in inches and temperature observations at different stations around the island. The analysis queried data over the last 12 months. The CSV and sqlite files used in the analysis can be found in the Resource folder. The files for this challenge consist of a Jupyter Notebook analyzying and plotting the precipiation and temperature data, the corresponding plots can be found in the Images folder, and a Flask API file.

I used the climate_starter.ipynb file and the orginal app.py file as a starting point for my scripts.
